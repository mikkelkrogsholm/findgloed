# React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces through composable components, with a declarative model for describing UI as a function of state.

## Documentation

- **Docs**: https://react.dev/llms.txt

## Key Capabilities

React has built-ins for things developers commonly reach for external packages to solve:

- **Unique IDs for accessibility**: use `useId()` — not `uuid` or `Math.random()` for linking labels to inputs
- **Debounced/deferred UI updates**: use `useDeferredValue()` or `useTransition()` — not lodash debounce for keeping UI responsive during expensive renders
- **Code splitting**: use `React.lazy()` + `<Suspense>` — no extra bundler plugins or dynamic import wrappers needed
- **Optimistic UI**: use `useOptimistic()` (React 19+) — not manual state juggling for instant feedback before server confirms
- **External store integration**: use `useSyncExternalStore()` — not custom subscription hooks that miss concurrent-mode edge cases
- **Form action state**: use `useActionState()` (React 19+) — not separate loading/error/data useState triplets for form submissions
- **Memoization**: use React Compiler (babel-plugin-react-compiler) — not manual `useMemo`/`useCallback` everywhere; the compiler handles it automatically

## Best Practices

- **State updates are asynchronous** — reading state immediately after `setState` returns the old value. Use the functional updater form `setState(prev => ...)` when the new value depends on the previous, and read updated values in the next render, not inline.
- **`useEffect` intentionally runs twice in StrictMode** — React mounts, unmounts, then remounts in development to expose missing cleanup. This is not a bug; always return a cleanup function from effects with subscriptions, timers, or event listeners.
- **List keys must be stable and unique** — using array index as `key` breaks state preservation on reorder/filter. Always use a stable ID from the data (e.g., `item.id`).
- **`'use client'` placement matters for Server Components** — placing the directive at a layout or page root converts the entire subtree to client code, eliminating Server Component benefits. Push `'use client'` as far down the tree as possible, to the smallest interactive leaf components.
